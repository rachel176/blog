    <h1><strong>My Life with Dogs</strong></h1>
    
    <h2>My two teddy bears, Ein and Dew, are super adorable, silly, and sassy. Here you will find pictures and anecdotes about our adventures with them!</h2>
    
    <div class="dogs">
        <p>Ein is the oldest pup that we have, and we took a lot of pictures of him as a baby, especially silly ones where he is playing or sleeping.</p>

        <p>Ein was definitely more of a dog-dog, so we got him a friend. We named his buddy, Dew.</p>

        <p>Overall, we have some pretty spoiled pups... They love being by us and watching outside, which is pretty easy to do with our home setup.</p>

        <p>Both dogs are unique in their own way... Ein needed treats to learn how to walk away from home while Dew was thrilled to go on a run with me. Here's Ein walking after some training and after my first successful outdoor run with Dew!</p>
